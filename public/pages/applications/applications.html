          <h3>Participation</h3>
          <i>People in the system share the responsibility of running the system.</i>
          <p>The <a href="../blockchain/blockchain.html">Blockchain</a> is a light and flexible system that retains qualities that allow it to run independently of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralisation">centralized</a> organizations such as banks, governments or companies. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization">decentralized</a> technology, supported and managed by the participants of the system. In other words: by the people for the people. It provides security and accountability for all parties and therefore removes the need for many kinds of 'middle men' that make money by taking a cut for themselves during an exchange between two parties. In the coming decades the blockchain will facilitate the most democratic and efficient systems that have ever existed.</p>

          <i>Those that created the system usually <a href="../ico/ico.html#hold">keep a portion of the cryptocurrency</a> that represents the value of the system and the only way for them to increase their value is for the system to become increasingly popular. They cannot charge a fee in the system and because of this the creators act more like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit)" >nonprofit foundation</a> than a company or corporation.</i>

          <h3>Contracts</h3>
          <i>A blockchain can hold onto your contracts instead of a lawyer.</i>
          <p>The <a href="../blockchain/blockchain.html">blockchain</a> is an immutable ledger and because of this it is a fantastic place for recording contracts between multiple parties. If a contract on the blockchain is changed, the previous version of the contract will always be available. In many situations this removes the need for agreements to be held by an unbiased third party, such as a lawyer. If there is foul play, and one party decides to change the contract, without the other parties consent, the proof that a contract has been altered will always be available.</p>

          <h3>Voting</h3>
          <i>Enforced democracy on the Blockchain.</i>
          <p>The blockchain allows 'voting' via a few methods. It is an immutable ledger and therefore a fantastic place to implement
            tradition voting systems because votes cannot be altered once they are recorded. Another method to vote is simply by
            participating within the blockchain system or withdrawing your participation. A blockchain is managed and run by the
            people in the system, if the blockchain is to be changed or altered in a way that the majority of the systems participants
            do not approve, then they can
            <i>refuse to participate</i>. The people making the change are in the same boat as the community. If the community decides
            to migrate to a competing blockchain, they will lose everything they have invested in the current one. No one can
            change a blockchain without the community's consent.</p>
          <i>An excellent example of this is on November 8th, 2017 a "fork" based on bitcoin called Seqwit2x, that was meant to take
            place in the following week, was
            <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html">cancelled</a>. It was cancelled because the bitcoin community overwhelmingly disagreed with the forks purpose and association
            with private parties.</i>

          <h3>Transactions</h3>
          <i>Get paid when your computer process transactions on a blockchain.</i>
          <p>As with any currency, cryptocurrencies must have a means of processing transactions that take place on the system. In order to accomplish this, participants within the crypto's community volunteer to have their machines process transactions that take place on that cryptocurrencies blockchain. For the processing power they donated they are often compensated a set amount of that cryptocurrency.</p>

          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <i>Get paid to share your computer's hard drive space.</i>
          <p>Transaction information and contracts can be stored using blockchain technology but the blockchain and the information on it, <a href="../blockchain/blockchain.html">must be physically stored</a> in computer memory. Just like the systems transactions, this responsibility is shared throughout the crypto community. Volunteers share space on their computers, mobile phones and hard drives. The blockchain is broken up into many pieces and spread across all these devices and as a bonus the information is duplicated and saved in the same manner, so that if one person's device crashes the information lost on that device can be retrieved from another. Some blockchains such as <a href="https://substratum.net/">Substratium</a> pay their users when they donate a portion of memory from their computers hard drive.</p>

          <h3>Computation</h3>
          <i>Get paid to share your computer's processing power.</i>
          <p>Decentralizing computation power is possible on the blockchain. The concept is for people to donate the processing power on their computers to a decentralized network on a blockchain and by adding the computational power of all the computers in the system a supercomputer can be made. Anybody who wishes to use this worldwide supercomputer would have access to it by paying a fee to those who contributed their computing power to the system.</p>
