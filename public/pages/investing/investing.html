          <h3>How</h3>
          <p>In order to buy and sell cryptocurrency you will need to sign up for a cryptocurrency <a href="../exchanges/exchanges">exchange</a>. This process is easy but can take a bit of time and know how. An exchange will often ask you to create an account on their website and, to begin with, this account will be attached to a small amount of privileges (such as buying small amounts of crypto). In order to extend these privileges you will be asked for pieces of identification. These can easily be uploaded by taking a picture or scanning the document.</p>
          <i>* A guide for setting up accounts and buying cryptocurrency on <a href="">Coinbase</a> and <a href="">Binance</a> can be found <a href="">here</a>. *</i>

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>When investing in anything, you must do your research. Analyze the product, what it's applications are and how many competitors are in the market. Take a look at the team who is building the company, what their history is and who is advising them. Lastly, research common investing practices, such as diversification, in order to mitigate your risks.</p>

          <h3>Market Cap</h3>
          <i><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Market Cap</a> takes the price of the coin and the circulating supply both into account.</i> 
          <p>It is a common mistake when determining a cryptocurrencies value to associate it with the price per coin (ex. cost per bitcoin:/{display bitcoin price}/). This is not correct and the reason is because a cryptocurrencies price per coin is heavily impacted by how many coins exist. For example a currency such as NEM that has 9 billion coins in circulation will likely never be the same price as Bitcoin which has a maximum supply of 21 Million.  When there is a larger supply the demand for the coin makes a smaller impact on the price per coin and therefore price alone cannot be used to determine the value (demand) of the crypto. NEM is still one of the most valued crypto currencies in the world with a sizable market cap. The market cap is the total value of all the coins in circulation and represents how valuable a cryptocurrency is. The market cap gives better insight into how the price of the currency will change over time.
          </p>
          <i>* The value of a crypto currency is it's <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">market cap</a>. This is the value of multiplying the total amount of coins by the price of the coin. *</i>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>The crypto space is currently undergoing an incredible rate of growth and financial infusion but it is occurring alongside a slow but accelerating pace of adoption. These variables are causing something seen similar during the dotcom bubble. There is major volatility in the market and therefore there are multiple risks. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Day trading is very difficult.</b> If you plan on making short term trades and playing the market, hopefully you have previous investing experience. However if you do not have any previous experience, many people would suggest to just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2b8t78/whats_hodl/">hodl</a> your crypto and invest long term.
          </li>      
          <br>  
          <li>
            <b>Many crypto companies won't survive.</b> Even if a crypto seems promising, depending on their competition, funding, team and the products rate of adoption it may not survive. This is survival of the fittest and if consumers do not use the product, the product will die.
          </li>  
          <br>  
          <li>
            <b>Centralized exchanges can be hacked.</b> At this point in time cryptocurrency exchanges are centralized and therefore they store valuable data on their servers. This means that they are susceptible to a hack. In the past there have been cases where exchanges have been hacked and many people lost all the crypto they owned. In order to avoid this risk you can set up a <a href="../wallets/wallets.html">crypto wallet</a> which stores your crypto on that cryptos blockchain, where it can be safely accessed with a secret key.  
          </li>
          <br>
          <i>* There are blockchain companies who are trying to create a decentralized exchange. Check them out and consider buying some of their crypto. *</i>
        </ul>
        <p> In general the whole crypto market is going up. Just make sure you are making smart decisions. </p>
