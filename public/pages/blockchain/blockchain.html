          <h3>Ledger</h3>
          <i>A document that records everything</i>
          <p>The Blockchain is a structural concept of how to organize information on computer hard drives. It stores information across multiple hard drives by <i>linking</i> "blocks" together in what is known as a "chain". These blocks are added to the chain in the order that they are created and each block, tracks and holds every detail about what is happening in the system. Anything that happens such as cryptocurrency transactions, contracts, voting or just random events, will all be recorded and accessible on the blockchain. </p>

          <h3>Immutable</h3>
          <i>The ledger cannot be changed</i>
          <p>When something is added to the blockchain it cannot be deleted. It can be marked as irrelevant but it will always remain as a record. This becomes very useful when implementing contracts or sorting out discrepancies between two parties. If a contract is made on the blockchain neither party can alter or lie about the agreement because every change made to the contract will remain in a record.</p>

          <h3>Network</h3>
          <i>A community of shared resources</i>
          <p>Unlike a historical storage system such as a database or a hard drive, the blockchain isn't physically stored in one place. Instead it is cut up into many pieces and multiple copies of information is distributed across a network of computers. This is called a <a href="../decentralization/decentralization.html">decentralized</a> infrastructure. The computers that contribute to this global database, are owned and managed by normal people, who are often compensated for contributing their computers, by receiving an automated payment in the form of cryptocurrency.</p>

        <h3>Durable</h3>
        <i>There is always a backup</i>
        <p>The blockchain is decentralized across a network of computers (just like the internet) and because of this, it is extremely durable. If one <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/node">node</a>(computer) in the network goes down, there are other nodes that can compensate. One such example of this (and as mentioned earlier): multiple copies of the information stored in the blockchain are distributed across all of the computers in the network and therefore if one computer goes down then the information can still be retrieved from other nodes.</p>

      <div class="col s8">
        <h3>Secure</h3>
        <i>Computers save information on each other and keep one another in check</i>
        <p>In a decentralized network where there are multiple nodes, there are many checks and balances that a node can perform by checking with its peers (other nodes in the network). If someone was to attempt to hack a node in the blockchain they would have to replicate the nodes peers and therefore essentially the entire network. This would take an very large amount of computational power and without quantum computing is very unlikely.</p>
